/**
 * debugfs_create_u16 - create a debugfs file that is used to read and write an unsigned 16-bit value
 * @name: a pointer to a string containing the name of the file to create.
 * @mode: the permission that the file should have
 * @parent: a pointer to the parent dentry for this file.  This should be a
 *          directory dentry if set.  If this parameter is %NULL, then the
 *          file will be created in the root of the debugfs filesystem.
 * @value: a pointer to the variable that the file should read to and write
 *         from.
 *
 * This function creates a file in debugfs with the given name that
 * contains the value of the variable @value.  If the @mode variable is so
 * set, it can be read from, and written to.
 *
 * This function will return a pointer to a dentry if it succeeds.  This
 * pointer must be passed to the debugfs_remove() function when the file is
 * to be removed (no automatic cleanup happens if your module is unloaded,
 * you are responsible here.)  If an error occurs, %NULL will be returned.
 *
 * If debugfs is not enabled in the kernel, the value -%ENODEV will be
 * returned.  It is not wise to check for this value, but rather, check for
 * %NULL or !%NULL instead as to eliminate the need for #ifdef in the calling
 * code.
