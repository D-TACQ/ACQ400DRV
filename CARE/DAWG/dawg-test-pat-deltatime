# dawg-test-pat : sample test pattern for dawg
# walk a pair of switches one shift at a time, CH01 up from 0, CH02 down from 20
# activate four evenly spaced channels out of 20, 
# and left-shifts them by one at a time. 
# CH01.nn and CH02.nn are activating the same outputs:
# dt	CH01 bit mask	CH02 bit mask
# + indicates delta-time.
# The time is msec until start.
# First entry must be zero (no wait). We duplicate the first entry at the end
# in order to stretch the final state (0x00084210) to +300
